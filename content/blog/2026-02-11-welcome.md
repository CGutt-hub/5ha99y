This website serves as my central scientific presence, automatically syncing with GitHub (active projects), ORCID (publications), and other platforms.

## What to Expect

This blog will feature:
- **Research updates** — Progress on neural-autonomic synchrony and consciousness research
- **Volt engagement** — Data analytics and digital policy insights
- **Technical insights** — Tools, methods, and open science practices
- **CCC reflections** — Digital rights and technological transparency

## Philosophy

Everything here operates on principles of **open and transparent science**. Code, data, and ideas are shared to advance collaborative knowledge.
